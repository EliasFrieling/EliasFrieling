## About Me

I'm a graduating computer science major with industry experience in web development specializing in React and Node.js environments. Experienced working in both large and small teams and companies and passionate about expanding my skillset in both web development and other areas of software engineering.

## Experience

I've worked at Meta adding fucntionality to [Bento], an internal fork of GraphQL, (https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/09/20/eli5-bento-interactive-notebook-empowers-development-collaboration-best-practices/) where I created a custom input cell for GraphQL queries.

I also have experience doing web development at MEMX, a stock exchange, where I created a tool to enter orders into the exchange using React and Node.js
